# Overview
For this project I evaluated a dataset of 20 attributes and 3333 rows containing SyraTel's churn metrics. I outline my process of identifying the top indicators of churn and creating machine learning model to predict whether or not a client will soon churn. I was able to create several machine learning classification models and compare their performance on unseen data to decide on a final predictive model that SyriaTel could deploy on their current client database. My final model utilized sklearn's Decision Tree Classifier.
 
# Business Problem 
SyriaTel is a national telecommunications company interested in reducing how much money is lost because of customers who don't stick around very long, that is, reducing their churn rate. In the telecom industry, it costs [5 times](https://towardsdatascience.com/customer-churn-in-telecom-segment-5e49356f39e50) as much to acquire new business than it does to maintain existing clients. Given this information, it is important that SyriaTel ensures that its customers do not leave the company.
